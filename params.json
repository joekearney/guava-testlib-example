It's general enough to allow tests to be written for any interface and have them run against many different implementations.\r\n\r\nTests can be annotated with `Feature`s that correspond to differences in implementations of the interface specification &ndash; the same set of tests can be used to test mutable and immutable collections, for example, and the framework will decide which tests to add to which suite.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
